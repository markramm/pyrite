"""Per-principal STATUS goldens for every access-deciding route this harness
excludes from the per-KB matrix (ADR-0037 theme 0, #476 round-2 issue 3).

`REST_ACCESS_EXCLUSIONS` correctly keeps these OUT of
`test_rest_matrix.py`'s per-KB READABLE/PRIVATE/MISSING/NO_DEFAULT_ROLE axis
-- each one gates on `requires_tier("admin"/"write")` alone, with no per-KB
branch to vary that axis over (see each exclusion's own reason in
`surfaces.py`). But "no per-KB axis" is not "no access decision at all":
every route below decides admin-or-not (or write-tier-or-not) for the
CALLER, and before this file existed nothing pinned that decision -- cold
review (#476 round-2) found `DELETE /api/kbs/{name}` with its admin check
removed (mutation 5) passed silently, because the only place it appeared
was `REST_ACCESS_EXCLUSIONS`, which this harness's other tests never turn
into a live request.

**What this file covers.** The named categories from the round-2 cold
read: admin (index sync/jobs/usage/site-render), KB CRUD (create, delete,
reindex, gc, ephemeral), permissions/default-role, publish/commit/push,
settings, and user roles. Excluded from this file's own scope: pure
public/static routes with no access decision to characterize at all
(`/health`, `/robots.txt`, `/viewer*`, `/branding/*`, `/site/*`, `/auth/
login`+`register`+`logout` -- these authenticate or serve statically,
they do not decide access to an existing resource) and the GitHub OAuth
dance (`/auth/github/*`), whose "access decision" is entirely about a
THIRD PARTY's redirect flow, not this server's authorization.

**STATUS only, never the body.** The body of an admin listing (usage
stats, job ids, KB registry contents) is exactly the kind of volatile,
count-shaped content `normalize.py` blanks elsewhere -- pinning it here
would either fight that same battle again or (worse) quietly encode
today's admin usage numbers as "correct". The status code IS the access
decision (`INLINE_ACCESS_DECIDING_ROUTES`'s own principle: "the body can
be normalised; the status must not be" -- round-2 issue 3's own words).

**A dedicated, disposable, module-scoped world.** Several of these routes
are genuinely destructive (`DELETE /api/kbs/{name}`, `POST /api/kbs/gc`,
`POST /api/index/sync`) or create real state (`POST /api/kbs`,
`POST /api/kbs/ephemeral`). Never run against `world` (session-scoped,
relied on as read-only everywhere else) or `write_world` (shared with
`test_rest_matrix.py`'s and `test_mcp_matrix.py`'s write cases in whatever
module runs first) -- `access_world` is its own `build_world` call, used
by nothing else, so this file's mutations can never leak into another
file's assumptions about what a KB or listing contains. Every mutating
call here targets a KB/resource name this file made up
(`_DISPOSABLE_NAME`) rather than one of `world.py`'s seeded fixtures, so
even the one principal that reaches past the tier gate (`admin_key`) only
ever 404s ("not found"), never actually deleting or mutating anything a
different case depends on.

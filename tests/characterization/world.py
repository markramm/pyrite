"""Build one identically-shaped world -- KBs, principals, seeded content --
however many times a test module needs one (ADR-0037 theme 0).

One `PyriteConfig`, one `create_app()`, the ADR §5 KB axis -- readable,
private, a missing one that is simply never registered, and `NO_DEFAULT_ROLE`
(added to the axis per #476 blocker 5: the one state where a global user's
access and a local user's genuinely diverge, see below) -- plus one extra KB
the main matrix does not target (`READ_ONLY`, used by `test_error_bodies.py`'s
live cross-check only), and every principal the ADR §5.4 matrix names
(narrowed to the backlog item's concrete list). Every KB is seeded with at
least one entry (a leak has to have something in it to leak).

**Two worlds, not one (#476 round-2 blocker 1).** A single shared world was
the round-1 harness's whole determinism problem: a write-tool case (creating
an entry, starring one, ...) permanently changes a KB's content for the rest
of the process, so a READ case's own listing depends on which write cases
already ran before it -- an accumulated-content leak (a private KB's row
turning up in a readable KB's listing) was therefore indistinguishable from
ordinary noise, and normalisation had to blank most listings to survive
`-n4`, which also blanked away the very leaks this harness exists to catch.
The fix: `conftest.py` provides `world` (session-scoped, built ONCE via
`build_world`, and used ONLY by read/list/search cases -- nothing that
writes may touch it) and `write_world` (module-scoped, a FRESH
`build_world` call per test module, used ONLY by write-tool cases, whose content
mutations therefore never leak into a read case's golden). `build_world`
itself is unchanged in shape; `label` just lets a caller give its own
`tmp_path_factory` subdirectory a name, so two worlds built in the same
process don't collide on disk.

Principals (ADR-0037 §5, narrowed to the backlog item's concrete list):

- ``anonymous``   -- no credential at all.
- ``read_key``    -- an operator API key, role "read".
- ``write_key``   -- an operator API key, role "write".
- ``admin_key``   -- an operator API key, role "admin".
- ``global_user`` -- a session for a user seeded the operator's way
  (``AuthService.create_user``, what ``tests/auth_seed.py`` calls "the
  operator path"): ``global_access=True``, so their role covers every KB
  without a ``default_role``. Role "read".
- ``local_user``  -- a session for a *self-registered* user
  (``AuthService.register``, no invite code): ``global_access=False``. Gets
  ``read`` on the readable KB (its ``default_role``) and nothing on the
  private KB until granted -- this is the harness's stand-in for "without
  global access".
- ``granted_user`` -- a self-registered user (``global_access=False``) who
  was then given an explicit per-KB grant on the private KB
  (``AuthService.grant_kb_permission``) -- "with global access" is read as
  "with access", i.e. a grant that reaches the KB a bare self-registration
  cannot; see the report's Unsure note.

KBs:

- ``READABLE`` -- ``default_role="read"``: open to any authenticated (and,
  since ``anonymous_tier="read"``, anonymous) caller.
- ``PRIVATE``  -- ``default_role="none"``: exists, invisible without a
  grant or global access.
- ``MISSING``  -- a name no ``KBConfig`` registers. Never created on disk.
- ``READ_ONLY`` -- ``default_role="read"``, ``read_only=True``: readable by
  anyone READABLE is, but every write raises ``KBReadOnlyError`` -- used by
  `test_error_bodies.py`'s live cross-check, not the main matrix.
- ``NO_DEFAULT_ROLE`` -- `default_role` left unset (``None``): the one KB
  state where a global user's role (falls back to it) and a local user's
  (does not) actually diverge -- part of the main `KB_STATES` axis in
  `test_rest_matrix.py`/`test_mcp_matrix.py` (#476 blocker 5); see also
  `test_global_access.py`'s small, direct pair of cases pinning the
  mechanism by name.

Every principal is also given a matching MCP `readable_kbs`/`writable_kbs`
pair and API-key role, computed the same way REST resolves it
(`api.kbs_for_user_at_tier`), so the REST and MCP goldens exercise the same
world through the same identities.

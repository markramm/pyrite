"""Normalise the volatile fields out of a golden case before it is compared
or recorded (ADR-0037 theme 0's "say what you normalised").

Three kinds of value in a response body are not stable across a
regeneration, a machine, or a run, and would make every golden fail for a
reason that has nothing to do with authorization or error-shape behaviour:

1. **Timestamps** -- ``created_at``/``updated_at``/``date``-shaped ISO 8601
   strings (ADR-0037's world always seeds fixed dates for entry ``date``, but
   a handler may still report `datetime.now()` for a write's timestamp).
2. **Generated ids** -- job ids, session tokens, commit hashes: strings this
   harness's own fixture setup does not choose (contrast with entry ids like
   ``READABLE_ENTRY``, which are fixed and NOT normalised, because a
   changed entry id in a body would be a real behaviour change to catch).
3. **Filesystem paths** -- the world's `tmp_path_factory` directory appears
   verbatim in some error messages (`ConfigSaveRefusedError.config_file`,
   `BrandingInvalidError`'s str()) and changes on every run.

The list is short and explicit on purpose: a normaliser that is too clever
(e.g. "replace anything that looks like a number") would launder a real
status-code or error-code change into a false pass, which is exactly the
failure mode the mutation-check in the report proves does not happen.

# -- MCP enumeration-sensitive tools -----------------------------------------
#
# A KB-bearing MCP tool's success body is either IDENTITY-BASED (its content
# depends only on the one row/entry/task the call names -- kb_get, kb_update,
# task_status, zettel_graph, every _MUTATES_ITS_ENTRY tool, ...) or
# ENUMERATION-SENSITIVE (its content is a count, list or aggregate over
# "everything in a KB" or "everything matching a filter" -- kb_search,
# kb_stats, kb_batch_suggest, investigation_find_duplicates, task_list, ...).
#
# The matrix's own write-tool cases (kb_create, task_create, social_post, ...)
# permanently add rows to the shared world for the rest of the test session,
# and each one also triggers QAService's auto-assessment side effect (another
# new row). An enumeration-sensitive tool's result is therefore a function of
# *which other cases already ran in the same process* -- not just of
# (tool, principal, kb_state) -- so its COUNT and the exact CONTENT of any
# volatile per-item field (a timestamp, a rank, an auto-assessment id) cannot
# be pinned byte for byte.
#
# What CAN and MUST be pinned: **which rows a caller can see at all** -- the
# whole reason this harness exists. Blanking an entire list field to one
# fixed marker (what this table used to do) makes that invisible: MCP
# `kb_list` leaking a private KB's name into the response passed every test,
# because `normalize_mcp_result` replaced the whole `knowledge_bases` list --
# leaked or not -- with the same `<ENUMERATION_CONTENT>` string (#476 blocker
# 2, cold review). So instead of blanking a listed field wholesale, this
# module PROJECTS it down to identity only: a sorted list of KB names (for a
# list of KB dicts), or a sorted list of `(kb_name, id)` pairs (for a list of
# entry/row dicts) -- keeping exactly the two things that answer "did this
# caller see something they should not have" -- and drops every other,
# volatile per-item key. A field that is a bare int/float count (not a list)
# is still blanked, since a count is real content-state noise with no
# identity of its own to preserve.
NORMALISED_ENUMERATION_CONTENT = "<ENUMERATION_CONTENT>"

# Per-item keys that identify a KB in a listing (kept, sorted by, never
# blanked) vs. an entry/row (kept as (kb_name, id), sorted, never blanked).

    2 splits read cases onto their own world that no write case ever

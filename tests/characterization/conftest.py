"""Two worlds for the ADR-0037 theme-0 characterization harness.

`world` (session-scoped -- once per xdist worker, since xdist gives each
worker its own process) is READ-ONLY by convention: every read/list/search
case runs against it, and nothing may write through it, so its content is
exactly what `world.py`'s seeding put there for the life of the worker.

`write_world` is a MODULE-scoped world (one fresh `build_world` call per
test *module* that asks for it -- `test_rest_matrix.py`'s write loop and
`test_mcp_matrix.py`'s write loop each get their own, never one shared
across modules and never the same object as `world`). Round 1 already
solved individual write CASES colliding with each other inside one world
(unique `call_key`-derived identity fields, disposable entries for a tool
that mutates an existing row); module-level isolation is the next
granularity up -- it keeps a write module's OWN listing verifications
(does the entry I just wrote actually show up) free of whatever a
DIFFERENT module's write cases already added, while still building only a
handful of worlds total rather than one per individual case (which would
also work, just at a much higher, unnecessary cost: this harness's write
surface is a small minority of its whole matrix).

# outcome to ANY exception raised in ANY phase of that test item -- setup,
# call, AND teardown -- when the marker has no `raises=` (read directly:
# `elif not rep.skipped and xfailed:` does not branch on `call.when` before
# checking `call.excinfo`). An assertion raised from this fixture's own
# post-yield code during an xfail(strict=True) test's own teardown is
# therefore swallowed as a second, identical XFAIL instead of failing the
# run -- confirmed empirically against `test_kb_protected_live_over_rest`
# (`xfail(strict=True)`, no `raises=`) while writing this guard: the leak was
# real (proven directly against `world.config.knowledge_bases`) but a
# teardown-phase assert on that same item was invisible in the test report.
# Deferring the check to the NEXT world-using item's setup lands the
# assertion in a DIFFERENT item -- one `xfailed` is not stashed for -- so it
# fails for real, while still naming the true offender by nodeid (the
# "before" snapshot is captured at the offender's OWN setup, i.e. before it
# runs, precisely so the comparison is "what did THIS test change", not
# "what changed since the test before it").

    `world` is built once per xdist worker and read by every later

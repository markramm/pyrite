"""
Authorization coverage: every mutating /api route must reject a read-tier caller.

`create_app()` mounts all endpoint routers behind a read-tier floor, and
individual routes escalate with `requires_tier` / `requires_kb_tier`. Nothing
else verifies the escalation is complete -- a new POST added without a guard
inherits only the floor and is silently callable by any read-tier key. This
test makes that a CI failure instead of an audit finding
(backlog: api-authorization-coverage-test).

The check is behavioural rather than a walk of route dependencies:

- Routes are enumerated from `app.openapi()["paths"]`, FastAPI's stable public
  view (a `.routes` walk breaks on >= 0.139's `_IncludedRouter` wrappers).
- Each mutating route is called with a read-tier key and an empty JSON body.
  Tier guards are dependencies that raise 403 before body validation is
  reported, so a guarded route answers 403 whatever the body looks like; an
  unguarded one answers 422/404/200/500 -- anything but 403.

Deliberate exceptions live in READ_TIER_ALLOWED, so exposing a mutating-method
route to read-tier callers requires editing that list in the same diff.

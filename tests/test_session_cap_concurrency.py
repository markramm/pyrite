"""The session cap holds under concurrent logins (#435).

Property: at every commit point a user holds at most
``auth.max_sessions_per_user`` sessions -- for password logins, OAuth logins,
and the two racing each other for the same user. Every token a login returned
either still verifies or was evicted, and each eviction is announced as a
``CredentialChange`` after its commit, so the evicted session's sockets close
(#433's contract).

Pattern from ``tests/test_task_claim_concurrency.py``: a start barrier so the
logins actually contend, and one deadline for the whole group rather than a
fixed per-thread timeout. Threads, not processes: the server serves logins
from worker threads of one process, and each thread here opens its own
``PyriteDB`` on the one file database, as separate requests would.

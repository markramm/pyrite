"""``POST /api/index/sync?wait=true`` actually re-renders the site cache (#349).

Same root cause as #326/#322: the sync handler is a plain ``def`` route, so
it runs on a worker thread with no running event loop. The old code called
``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` from there, which raises, and a broad
``except Exception`` swallowed it -- so the site cache was never rendered.
A second, independent bug hid behind the first: the guard that was supposed
to skip the render when unconfigured (``if cache_svc.config:``) read
``request.app.state.config``, which nothing in the server ever sets, so it
was always ``None`` and the render never even reached the loop lookup.

**Surface.** A ``TestClient`` used as a context manager, so the app's
lifespan runs (startup binds the loop -- #326's ``bind_loop``/``_loop`` --
even though this fix does not need it, since the render happens
synchronously while the caller is already waiting). A markdown file is
written directly into the KB path (mirroring an external edit, exactly like
``tests/test_integration.py::test_manual_file_creation_syncs``) so
``sync_incremental`` reports a real ``added`` count, then
``POST /api/index/sync?wait=true`` is called and the rendered site-cache
file is checked on disk.

The KB is created with ``default_role="read"``: since the security-batch-2
change, ``/site`` (and ``SiteCacheService.render_all``) renders only public
KBs (``public_kbs.public_kb_names``); a KB with no default role renders
nothing, which would pass this test for the wrong reason.

**Cold-read fix round (2026-09-25).** The first pass made a render failure
fail the *sync itself*: a 500, skipping ``_drain_embed_queue`` and the
``kb_synced`` broadcast, and leaving a retry with ``added=0`` (nothing
changed, so it would never render again). Sync and render are now reported
independently -- the sync commits, drains and broadcasts regardless, and the
render's own outcome rides along on ``SyncResponse.site_cache`` (``{rendered,
error}``). "No broad except hiding the failure" now means: the failure is
visible in the response and the log (with a traceback), not that it must
raise and take the whole request down with it.

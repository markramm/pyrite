"""`ci.yml` must gate a merge group, and must fail CLOSED when it cannot classify it.

GitHub's merge queue needs a `merge_group:` trigger before it can be switched
on: a queued PR waits on the required check (`gate`), and a workflow that does
not trigger on `merge_group` never produces one. See GitHub issue #273.

The hazard this module exists for is not "CI breaks loudly" -- it is `gate`
going GREEN on a merge group where every job skipped:

`changes` classifies the diff with `dorny/paths-filter`, which reads the PR's
changed-file list only for the events in its own `prEvents` list
(`pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, `pull_request_review`,
`pull_request_review_comment`). `merge_group` is NOT one of them (upstream
issue dorny/paths-filter#280), so on a merge group the action falls through to
`getChangedFilesFromGit(base, ref)` with `base` unset -- which resolves to
`github.context.payload.repository.default_branch` (`dev` here) and diffs the
`gh-readonly-queue/...` ref against it, over a checkout whose default
`fetch-depth: 1` does not contain that history. That path either errors or
yields an arbitrary classification.

Whatever it yields, the downstream failure is the same shape: every heavy job
is `if: needs.changes.outputs.<x> == 'true'`, a skipped job satisfies a
required check, and `gate` is `if: always()` failing only on
`failure|cancelled`. An all-false classification therefore skips the entire
matrix and reports the one required check GREEN having tested nothing -- which
is strictly worse than having no merge queue at all.

So `changes` must not depend on that action's merge_group behaviour. On
`merge_group` it reports EVERYTHING changed, so every gated job runs. Running
too much for a queued group is correct and cheap; running nothing and saying
so in green is not.

The interpreter *matrix* is a separate decision from which jobs run. It was
narrow on a merge group (maintainer, 2026-09-21), on the reasoning that the
push to `dev` after the queue's merge still runs all three, so breadth was
delayed by one step rather than lost. That delay is exactly what let #388
land through PR CI and the (narrow) merge queue on 3.12 alone, then redden
`dev`'s post-merge matrix on 3.13 (`Path.resolve()` no longer raises on a
symlink loop in non-strict mode) -- `dev` stayed red for about an hour and
blocked a release cut (#400). The merge queue runs on the exact commit that
is about to land, at the cost of queue runner minutes rather than wall time
(the legs run in parallel), so as of #400 (maintainer approved 2026-09-25) it
runs the full matrix too. `pull_request` alone stays narrow.
`TestTheMatrixNarrowsWhereItShould` evaluates that expression per event
instead of grepping it.

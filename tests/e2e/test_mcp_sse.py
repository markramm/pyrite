"""MCP over SSE against a live server, driven the way Claude Code drives it.

Regression for PR #3. `mount_mcp_routes()` nests the SSE app under
`Mount("/mcp", ...)` but constructed `SseServerTransport("/mcp/messages/")`.
The SDK builds the client-facing POST path as
`scope["root_path"].rstrip("/") + self._endpoint`, and `root_path` is already
"/mcp" by then -- so the emitted `event: endpoint` pointed at
`/mcp/mcp/messages/?session_id=...`, which is not a registered route. The SSE
handshake looked fine and every real client died on its first POST with a 404.

`tests/test_mcp_routes.py` never asserted the emitted path, so nothing in
~4000 tests saw it. The `sse_session_result` fixture (conftest) reads the
endpoint event off the wire and completes a real session over it: initialize,
tools/list, kb_search. Everything below reads from that one session.

"""REST over a real socket: create a KB, write into it, find it — no restart.

Regression for PR #4. `KBRegistryService.add_kb()` wrote the KB to the `kb`
table but never refreshed `PyriteConfig._db_kb_cache`, which `create_app()`
populates exactly once on first DB access. So the KB existed in the database
and was invisible to every name lookup — including entry creation — for the
rest of the process's life. A `POST /api/kbs` followed by `POST /api/entries`
returned 404 KB_NOT_FOUND until the pod was restarted.

Nothing in the unit suite could see this: it is a property of one long-lived
process serving several requests, and a TestClient test that builds a fresh app
per test never has a stale cache to be wrong about.

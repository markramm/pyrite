"""Contract test for `-k` / `--kb` flag consistency across common commands.

Regression coverage for `consistent-kb-flag-across-commands`: the common
read/index commands that filter by KB must all accept the `-k` / `--kb`
shorthand (the bug's original repro `index sync -k` used to fail with
"No such option: -k"). This locks the flag so it can't regress.

Commands that take a single *required* KB as a positional argument
(`kb info`, `qa assess`, `index reconcile`, …) are intentionally excluded —
positional is their established convention and converting them would break
existing callers.

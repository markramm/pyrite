"""One inventory of Pyrite's entry points, shared by the structural tests.

ADR-0037 asks that the layer ratchet (#380, ``test_layer_boundaries.py``)
and the coming access-policy guard (ADR-0037 §5) walk **one** list of what
a surface is, so the two can never disagree about it. This module is that
list. It enumerates what runs a request, from the real objects rather than
from a hand-kept table:

- ``rest_operations()``: every ``APIRoute`` of ``create_app()`` -- ``/api``,
  ``/auth``, the SEO and site routes -- one ``EntryPoint`` per method.
- ``mcp_tools()``: every tool of an admin-tier ``PyriteMCPServer`` (the
  admin tier registers every tool, core and plugin).

What neither walk sees is named in ``NON_ROUTE_ENTRY_POINTS`` (the same two
surfaces ``test_read_scoping_is_structural.py`` records), and the CLI and
the Streamlit UI are modules rather than registries; the layer ratchet
covers them by path.

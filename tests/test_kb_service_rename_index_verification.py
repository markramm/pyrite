"""Regression tests for read-back index verification on KBService.rename_entry.

verify-after-write-on-the-index-path (second checklist item): a rename
that succeeds on disk but whose index sync silently fails or misses the
new entry currently only logs a warning — old_id keeps resolving in
search/lookups and new_id stays invisible, discovered only at the next
manual `index sync`. This must surface in the result, not just a log line.

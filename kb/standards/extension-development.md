Worked examples: `extensions/zettelkasten`, `extensions/encyclopedia` and
`extensions/social` are example plugins built to this standard — read their
`plugin.py`, `entry_types.py` and `README.md` alongside these rules. They
demonstrate entry types, CLI commands, MCP tools, presets, hooks, workflows
and custom DB tables; they are reference code for plugin authors, not
supported products.

## Package Structure

## Entry Type Rules
- Subclasses MUST override `from_frontmatter()` to map custom fields
- `to_frontmatter()` MUST set `meta["type"]` and SHOULD omit default values
- Use helper for common NoteEntry kwargs to reduce boilerplate

## Validator Rules
- Return `[]` for unrelated entry types (type-dispatched)
- Use severity="warning" for advisory checks
- DB table names MUST be prefixed with plugin name to avoid collisions

### Validator signature

A validator returned from `get_validators()` MUST bind exactly
`(entry_type: str, fields: dict, ctx: dict) -> list[dict]`. There is one
contract; there is no 2-argument `(entry_type, fields)` fallback and no
`(entry: Entry)` object form. `PluginRegistry` checks the signature with
`inspect.signature(...).bind` **at registration**, not at call time: a
validator that does not bind the contract is logged and dropped before it
ever runs, rather than raising a `TypeError` on every write that gets
swallowed by a broad `except Exception` and silently disables validation for
that plugin (#379, #376, #48 — two in-tree extensions shipped for months
with a 1-argument, `list[str]`-returning validator that never actually ran).

Each returned item is a dict, not a string: `{"field": ..., "rule": ...,
"message": ..., "severity": "warning"}` (`severity` omitted or anything
other than `"warning"` is treated as an error). `field`/`rule`/`expected`/
`got` are conventional, used by callers that build a human-readable message
or match on a specific rule (e.g. `index.py`'s invalid-status check matches
`field == "status"` and `rule == "enum"`); only `message` (or `field`, as a
fallback label) is required.

Lifecycle hooks (`get_hooks()`) have the equivalent rule: every callable
MUST bind `(entry, ctx)`. The registry checks this the same way, at
registration.

Write a test using the real plugin instance, not a fixture that hand-crafts
a conforming callable: `plugin.get_validators()` (or `get_hooks()`) fed
through `inspect.signature(...).bind(...)` with the contract's argument
shape, the way `tests/test_plugin_contract.py` does for every installed
plugin. That test would have caught #376/#48 the day the validator was
written, not months later against production data.

## CLI Rules
- CLI module imported lazily inside `get_cli_commands()` to handle missing typer
- Dependencies list should be empty — pyrite is a peer dependency

Add network-accessible MCP transport (SSE or Streamable HTTP) mounted at /mcp on the FastAPI app. Bearer token auth mapped to user accounts with per-KB permission enforcement. Enables Claude Desktop and Claude Code to connect to the hosted instance.

MCP SDK has mcp.server.sse and mcp.server.streamable_http available. Need: transport wiring, auth middleware, per-request user context propagation to tool handlers.

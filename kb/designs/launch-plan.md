# Launch Plan: Content Matrix & User Acquisition Strategy

Target: 0.16 launch release. Milestones 0.13-0.16 build toward launch day: UI hardening (0.13), auth & rate limiting (0.14), deployment & demo (0.15), ecosystem & onboarding (0.16). See [[roadmap]] for milestone details.

This document is the overview. Detailed content lives in linked sub-documents:

| Section | Document | What It Covers |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Messaging | [[launch-messaging]] | Core insight, elevator pitches, pain story, objection responses, BHAG pitch, per-wave messaging, three portals narrative |
| User types | [[launch-user-types]] | Five audience profiles with hooks, demo priorities, and objections |
| Channels | [[launch-channels]] | HN, Reddit, blog post structure, video demos, tutorial, email, dev.to, MCP directory, social media |
| Staging | [[launch-staging]] | Four-wave rollout with checklists, pre-launch infrastructure, weekly distribution plan |
| Web presence | [[launch-web-presence]] | Three-layer web architecture (pyrite.dev / docs / demo site), extension registry, Discord community |

## Demo Datasets & KBs

Pre-built KBs for impressive demos:

| Dataset | Source | Entry Count | Best For |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **4800-event timeline** | Already built | ~4800 | Claude Desktop demo, search impressiveness, PKM intro |
| **Pyrite's own KB** | This repo's `kb/` | ~200 | "We use it to build it", Claude Code demo |
| **Awesome Python** | awesome-python GitHub | ~1600 | Python dev outreach, search demo ("find me async HTTP libs") |
| **CVE/vulnerability data** | NIST NVD JSON feeds | 1000+ (curated subset) | Security angle, corporate KB demo |
| **RFC summaries** | IETF | ~500 (curated) | Knowledge graph demo (RFCs reference each other heavily) |
| **Python top packages** | PyPI JSON API | ~500 | Python dev outreach, dependency graph visualization |

**Content needed:**
- [ ] Import scripts for each dataset (in `examples/` directory)
- [ ] Curated subsets that demo well (not raw dumps)
- [ ] Each dataset has a matching `--template` or schema definition
- [ ] Verify knowledge graph looks good with each dataset

## Open Questions

- ~~Where to host the blog post?~~ **Resolved:** Blog section on pyrite.dev (the marketing site)
- YouTube vs embedded video hosting?
- Pricing/licensing messaging — is MIT sufficient or does it need explicit "free forever" language?
- Should we target Product Hunt as well? (probably week 3-4, not launch day)
- Is there a launch week "challenge" angle? ("Build a KB for your domain in 10 minutes")
- ~~Should the extension registry be its own repo or a directory in the main repo?~~ **Resolved:** Awesome-list approach first (curated markdown), evolves into full registry (#84) in 0.13
- ~~Demo site domain name?~~ **Resolved:** demo.pyrite.dev for the live demo, pyrite.dev for the marketing site
- ~~Demo site content moderation?~~ **Resolved:** No user-generated content. Demo loads curated awesome-list KBs only. Users publish their own KBs via git repos.
- ~~Demo site AI costs?~~ **Resolved:** All AI features are BYOK. No server-side inference. Hosting is compute + Postgres only.

Create a Claude Code skill/agent that can scaffold new pyrite extensions from a description. Should use the proven 8-section test pattern, package structure, and entry type conventions captured in extension-building-learnings.md.

Inputs needed: extension name, entry types with fields, which capabilities needed (hooks, workflows, DB tables, etc.), permission model choice.

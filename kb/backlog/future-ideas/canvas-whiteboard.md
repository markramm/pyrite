Freeform spatial canvas for visual thinking:

- Arrange entry cards, images, and text blocks on an infinite canvas
- Draw connections between items
- Group items into regions
- Zoom and pan
- Save canvas layouts as entries

Inspired by Obsidian Canvas and Notion's whiteboard. Useful for visual brainstorming, investigation mapping, and relationship visualization beyond the structured graph view.

**Lower priority** because: the knowledge graph (Phase 3) covers structured relationship visualization, and this is a very large implementation effort. Consider after core features are solid.

Multiple view modes for entry lists — Notion's signature feature:

**Table View:**
- Spreadsheet-like with sortable/filterable columns
- Columns: title, type, date, importance, tags, KB
- Inline editing of metadata fields
- Column resize and reorder

**Board View:**
- Kanban-style board grouped by status, type, or custom field
- Drag entries between columns
- Good for tracking investigation status

**Gallery View:**
- Card grid with preview snippet
- Good for browsing research entries visually

**Implementation:**
- View mode toggle on entry list page
- View preferences saved per page/context
- Reusable view components

Large effort but high impact for power users managing many entries.

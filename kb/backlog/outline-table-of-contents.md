Auto-generated table of contents from entry headings:

- Sidebar panel (collapsible) showing document structure
- Extracts headings (H1-H6) from current entry
- Click heading to scroll/jump to that section
- Highlights current section as you scroll
- Updates live as you edit

Both Obsidian and Notion provide this. Essential for long research entries — journalists writing investigation timelines or analysis documents need quick navigation within a document.

Small effort — parse headings from Markdown, render a linked list, add scroll listeners.

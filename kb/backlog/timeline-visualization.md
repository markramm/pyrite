Visual timeline view for date-bearing entries (events, daily notes, dated research):

- CSS-based vertical timeline with date markers
- Entries positioned chronologically
- Color-coded by entry type
- Click to navigate to entry
- Date range filtering
- Zoom levels: day, week, month, year

Upgrades the current basic timeline list page into a proper visual representation.

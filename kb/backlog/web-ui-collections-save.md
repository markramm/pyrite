## Problem

`/collections/new` has a Create button that is disabled with a comment "not yet wired up." The QueryBuilder UI exists and works for building filter criteria, but saving does nothing. This is a dead-end page.

## Solution

Either:
1. Wire the save button to the backend collection creation endpoint (if it exists)
2. Or remove the `/collections/new` route and the "New Collection" link until the backend is ready — don't show users a form they can't submit

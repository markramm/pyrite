## Problem

`WorktreeService.ensure_worktree` pre-created the diff-index database at
`<worktree>/.pyrite/diff-index.db` but **never registered the KB inside it**.
The first overlay entry-write into a fresh worktree then failed with:

```
sqlite3.IntegrityError: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
```

…because the `entry` table's `kb_name -> kb.name` foreign key had no
matching row to point at.

## Impact

Hard-blocker on the multi-user write path ([ADR-0024](../adrs/0024-multi-user-collaboration.md)):
every brand-new worktree was unusable until the user got the magic SQL run
against the diff DB. There was no helpful error, just the raw SQLite
constraint message bubbling up — the user saw "save failed" with no actionable
detail.

Surfaced when exercising the worktree write path end to end during the
review-flow integration.

## Root cause

`pyrite/services/worktree_service.py:201` did:

```python
_diff_db = PyriteDB(diff_db_path)
_diff_db.close()
```

…which initialized the schema but inserted no KB row. The overlay backend
then did the obvious thing on first write and was correctly rejected by the
FK constraint.

## Fix

Register the KB in the diff DB at worktree creation (pointing at the
worktree path, with the same kb_type/description as the source KB) so the
FK is satisfied for every subsequent write. Implementation in commit
`9e13966`:

```python
_diff_db = PyriteDB(diff_db_path)
_diff_db.register_kb(
    name=kb_name,
    kb_type=kb_config.kb_type,
    path=str(worktree_path),
    description=kb_config.description,
)
_diff_db.close()
```

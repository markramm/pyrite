title: "Rewrite README for Pyrite"
kind: bug
status: completed
priority: high
effort: S
tags: [docs, dx]

The README.md still describes the upstream Zettelkasten project — credits "JoshChen", links to `github.com/joshylchen/zettelkasten`, and describes the Streamlit/CEQRC workflow. None of this reflects Pyrite.

Need a new README covering:
- What Pyrite is (multi-KB research infrastructure)
- Installation
- Quick start (CLI, MCP, API)
- Plugin/extension system
- Architecture overview (link to kb/designs/)
- Contributing

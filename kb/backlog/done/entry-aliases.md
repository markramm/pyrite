Multiple names for the same entry:

- Define aliases in frontmatter: `aliases: [CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, The Agency]`
- `[[CIA]]` resolves to the canonical entry

**Depends on:** wikilinks-and-autocomplete

Obsidian feature. Important when linking becomes central — journalists often refer to entities by different names (person's full name vs. nickname, organization's acronym vs. full name).

kind: feature
status: completed
priority: high

Bookmark frequently accessed entries:

- Star/unstar button on entry view and entry cards
- "Starred" section in sidebar above recent entries
- Stored in SQLite (user preferences, not in git — engagement-tier data)
- Drag to reorder starred entries
- Keyboard shortcut to toggle star on current entry

Both Obsidian (bookmarks) and Notion (favorites) have this. Critical for navigation in large KBs — recent entries alone aren't enough when you have a few entries you reference constantly.

Effort is S because it's a simple UI feature + one SQLite table.

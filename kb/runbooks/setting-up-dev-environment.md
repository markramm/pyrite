## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (3.13 recommended)
- git

## Steps

### 1. Clone and create venv
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd pyrite
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install pyrite with all optional dependencies plus dev tooling
```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```
`dev` alone (pytest, ruff, mypy, build, pre-commit) is tooling only — it has
no `fastapi` and no CLI deps, so it cannot even collect the suite. `all` is
the meta-extra `pyrite[server,cli,ai,semantic,dev]` and is what CONTRIBUTING
uses.

### 3. Install all extensions
```bash
for ext in extensions/*/; do pip install -e "$ext"; done
```
This installs every directory under `extensions/` as it exists today, so the
list here cannot drift out of sync the way an enumerated one has before.

### 4. Install pre-commit hooks
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### 5. Verify
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ extensions/ --collect-only -q
```
The suite is in the thousands and grows with every PR — run the command
above rather than trusting a number written here. If it errors instead of
reporting a collected count, step 2 or 3 above did not take.

## Troubleshooting
- If pre-commit pytest fails: ensure extensions are installed in `.venv/` not just system Python
- If ruff-format modifies files: re-stage and commit again (hooks run twice on failure)
- If `generate_entry_id()` errors: it takes only 1 arg (title), not 3

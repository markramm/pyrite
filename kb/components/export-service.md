`ExportService` handles KB export and git operations. Extracted from `KBService` in 0.18 to reduce god-class complexity.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `export_kb_to_directory()` | Export all entries as markdown files with YAML frontmatter |
| `export_kb_to_repo(kb_name, repo_url, github_token, branch, commit_message)` | Clone target repo, export entries into `kb_name/` subdirectory, commit, push. Full end-to-end export-to-GitHub flow |
| `commit_kb()` | Commit changes in a KB's git repository (delegates to `GitService`) |
| `push_kb()` | Push KB commits to a remote repository (delegates to `GitService`) |

## Architecture

Constructor takes `config: PyriteConfig` and `db: PyriteDB`. Git operations lazy-import `GitService` to avoid circular dependencies.

`KBService` retains facade delegator methods with identical signatures, so all consumer callsites remain unchanged.

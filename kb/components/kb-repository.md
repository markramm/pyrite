File-system layer for a single knowledge base. Reads and writes markdown files with YAML frontmatter, applies schema migrations on load, and routes entries into subdirectories. Source of truth for on-disk entry state. `MultiKBRepository` wraps multiple instances for cross-KB access.

## Key Methods

- `load(entry_id)` — find file, parse frontmatter, apply migrations, return `Entry`
- `save(entry, subdir)` — write entry to disk, enforce read-only check
- `delete(entry_id)` — remove file from disk
- `list_entries()` — iterate all entries and collection YAML files in the KB directory
- `find_file(entry_id)` — locate markdown file by ID across subdirectories
- `validate_all()` — return paths with validation errors
- `_maybe_migrate(frontmatter)` — apply schema version migrations on load
- `_infer_subdir(entry)` — determine target directory from schema/type rules

## Consumers

- `KBService` — primary consumer for all read/write operations
- `DocumentManager` — calls `save` and `delete` as part of the write-path pipeline
- `IndexManager` — calls `list_entries` during full re-index
- CLI commands and extension CLIs — direct access for import/export and migration tasks

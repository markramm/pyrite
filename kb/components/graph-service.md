`GraphService` handles graph and link operations for knowledge base entries. Extracted from `KBService` in 0.18 to reduce god-class complexity.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get_graph()` | Get graph data for visualization (delegates to `db.get_graph_data`) |
| `get_refs_to()` | Get entries referencing a given entry via object-ref fields |
| `get_refs_from()` | Get entries a given entry references via object-ref fields |
| `get_backlinks()` | Get entries that link TO a given entry (with pagination) |
| `get_outlinks()` | Get entries a given entry links TO |

## Architecture

All methods are thin wrappers around `PyriteDB` query methods. Constructor takes only `db: PyriteDB`.

`KBService` retains facade delegator methods with identical signatures, so all consumer callsites (endpoints, CLI, MCP) remain unchanged.

REST endpoint for block-level access to entry content.

- `GET /api/entries/{entry_id}/blocks` — returns blocks for an entry
  - Query params: `heading` (filter by heading), `block_type` (filter by type)
  - Returns `BlockListResponse` with `blocks[]` and `total` count
  - Ordered by position within the entry

Supports heading-level linking: `[[entry#heading]]` links resolve through this endpoint.

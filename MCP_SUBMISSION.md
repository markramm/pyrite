# MCP Server Submission: Pyrite Knowledge Infrastructure

## Repository Information

- **Repository**: https://github.com/markramm/pyrite
- **License**: MIT
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **MCP Transport**: STDIO
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic (AI providers optional)

## Project Summary

**Pyrite** is a knowledge infrastructure platform that gives AI agents structured, permissioned access to typed knowledge bases through MCP. It's the first MCP server with tiered access control — agents get read, write, or admin tools depending on trust level.

Knowledge lives as markdown files in git repositories with YAML frontmatter. Pyrite indexes them into SQLite FTS5 for fast search, validates entries against typed schemas, and exposes everything through MCP tools, a REST API, and CLI.

## What Makes This Different

**Three-tier permission model** — Most MCP knowledge servers expose flat read/write access. Pyrite separates tools into read (safe for untrusted agents), write (for trusted workflows), and admin (human-supervised). This solves the "I want my agent to use the KB but not corrupt it" problem.

**Typed entries, not text chunks** — Agents write structured entries (person, organization, event, document, or custom types defined in YAML) with field-level validation. Retrieval returns structured data, not similarity-ranked text fragments.

**Multi-KB with cross-references** — Mount multiple knowledge bases with different schemas. A research agent writes to one KB while a coding agent writes to another. Cross-KB links connect them. Search spans all mounted KBs.

**Self-documenting types for agents** — Every type carries AI instructions, field descriptions, and display hints through a 4-layer metadata resolution system. When an agent calls `kb_schema`, it gets not just field names but guidance on how to use each type. Agents write better entries with less prompt engineering.

**MCP prompts and resources** — Pre-built prompt templates (`research_topic`, `summarize_entry`, `find_connections`, `daily_briefing`) that agents can invoke. Browsable `pyrite://` URI resources for KB metadata discovery.

**Content negotiation** — Responses in JSON, Markdown, CSV, or YAML via format parameter. Agents request the format that fits their workflow.

## MCP Server Details

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyrite
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markramm/pyrite
cd pyrite
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyrite": {
      "command": "pyrite",
      "args": ["mcp", "--tier", "write"]
    }
  }
}
```

Set `--tier read` for untrusted agents, `--tier write` for trusted research workflows, `--tier admin` for human-supervised KB management. Use `pyrite-admin mcp` for admin-tier access.

| `kb_push` | Push KB git repository to remote |

#### Plugin Tools

Extensions register additional MCP tools per tier. Shipped examples:
- Software-KB: `sw_adrs`, `sw_backlog`, `sw_components`, `sw_standards`, `sw_new_adr`
- Task: `task_list`, `task_status`, `task_create`, `task_update`

### MCP Prompts

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `research_topic` | Guide agent through researching a topic across the KB |
| `summarize_entry` | Produce a structured summary of an entry and its connections |
| `find_connections` | Discover relationships between two entries |
| `daily_briefing` | Generate a briefing of recent KB activity |

### MCP Resources

Browsable `pyrite://` URIs expose KB metadata, entry lists, and type schemas for MCP clients that support resource discovery.

### Example Agent Interactions

```
"Search my research KB for everything about authentication architecture"
→ kb_search(query="authentication architecture", kb="software-kb", mode="hybrid")

"Create a new ADR about our decision to use Kafka"
→ kb_create(kb="software-kb", type="adr", title="Use Kafka for event streaming", ...)

"What events happened between 2020 and 2022 involving Company X?"
→ kb_timeline(date_from="2020-01-01", date_to="2022-12-31", query="Company X")

"Find connections between the auth-service component and the billing incident"
→ kb_backlinks(id="auth-service") + kb_get(id="billing-incident-2025")
```

## Core Entry Types

| Type | Key Fields | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `note` | tags, links, sources | General knowledge |
| `person` | role, affiliations, importance | People tracking |
| `organization` | org_type, jurisdiction, founding_date | Institutional analysis |
| `event` | date, importance (1-10), participants, status | Timeline events |

## Value Proposition

Pyrite is the first MCP server designed as **structured shared memory for AI agents**. Unlike vector stores that lose structure or flat files that can't be queried, Pyrite gives agents typed, validated, relationship-rich knowledge with permission-controlled access — all backed by git for auditability.

It's battle-tested on a real investigative journalism project (4,240+ timeline events, 323 knowledge base articles) and designed to generalize across domains: software architecture, legal research, policy analysis, or any field where knowledge has structure.

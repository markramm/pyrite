"""Backend capability declarations (Tier A r1400; locked design commit 3777cb5).

Note: an earlier draft of this docstring cited "ADR-0028", but that number was
later assigned to the backend-agnostic query DSL. The r1400 capability design
was never written up as a numbered ADR; the locked decision lives in commit
3777cb5.

Backend classes declare which of the 3 backend-protocol subsystems they
support via a ``capabilities: ClassVar[set[BackendCapability]]`` class
attribute. A dispatch helper (``backend_declares``) consults this set
before calling each method, skipping methods whose capability the
backend did not claim.

Locked design (commit 3777cb5, Option B). The 3 members mirror the
3-subsystem split documented in the r1400 ticket — an eventual move to
Option A (splitting into ``EntityStore``, ``SearchEngine``,
``EmbeddingStore`` protocols) is mechanical: each Capability becomes
its own Protocol with the same name.

Decision #2 from the locked design: this module handles ONLY the
class-attribute question ("can in principle do X"). The runtime
``is_available()`` check ("is the dependency installed right now")
stays where it already lives in each backend — they're two separate
gates.

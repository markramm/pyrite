"""HookRunner — orchestrates core and plugin lifecycle hooks.

Extracted from KBService so the hook contract (before-raises, after-swallows)
lives in one place rather than being open-coded inside CRUD methods.

## Contract

- ``before_save`` / ``before_delete``: hooks may raise. Any raised exception
  propagates to the caller, aborting persistence. The entry is NOT saved.
- ``after_save`` / ``after_delete``: hook exceptions are logged at WARNING and
  swallowed. The operation is already committed; bubbling an exception here
  would surface a "save failed" error to a caller whose save actually
  succeeded. A failing hook does NOT prevent subsequent hooks from running —
  each after-hook is an independent side effect.

This contract was previously implemented inside ``KBService._run_hooks`` as
a static method. The behavior is preserved exactly; only the home moved.

## Plugin hook dispatch

If a plugin registry is supplied at construction time, ``HookRunner`` will
also run plugin hooks (after the core hooks) under the same contract. Pass
``plugin_registry=None`` to use only core hooks (e.g. in unit tests).

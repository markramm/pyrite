"""Which KBs are public: the one rule every anonymous surface uses.

The pre-rendered `/site`, `/site/sitemap.xml` and the live `/sitemap.xml`
are served with no authentication, so they may only show KBs anyone may
read. Until `kb.yaml: published: true` ships, the signal is
``default_role == "read"``. A KB with ``default_role`` unset or ``"none"``
is private for these surfaces, whatever the global auth settings are.

Keep this the only place the rule is written: two copies drifted once
(the /site renderer used every KB while the sitemap used this rule).

"""REST's adapter to the access policy (ADR-0037 §2, #383).

The rule lives in `pyrite/services/access_policy.py`. This module holds only
the FastAPI side of asking it:

- `get_principal`: what `api.verify_api_key` recorded on the request, as a
  `Principal`. The one place REST turns request state into a caller.
- `authorize(action, resource)`: the one dependency a route declares to ask
  the policy. Theme 3a decides reads:

  - ``authorize(Action.KB_READ, KB)`` -- every KB the request names (path,
    query, JSON body; `api._resolve_kb_names`) must be readable, and one that
    is not answers 404 ``KB_NOT_FOUND``, byte-identical to a KB that does not
    exist. The dependency returns the caller's `ReadScope`, so a route that
    also spans KBs when none is named takes it as a parameter.
  - ``authorize(Action.KB_READ, AnyKB)`` -- the `ReadScope` alone, for a
    route that spans KBs and names none it must check.

  Writes (`requires_kb_tier`, theme 3b) and instance/user routes
  (`requires_tier`, theme 3c) still use their `api.py` dependencies; asking
  `authorize` for one of those fails when the route is declared.

`tests/test_every_entry_point_passes_the_policy.py` (ADR-0037 §5) fails for
any REST operation whose dependant tree lacks exactly one `authorize(...)`,
unless it is public or on that test's shrinking not-yet-migrated list.

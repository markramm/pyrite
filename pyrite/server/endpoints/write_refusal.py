    ADR-0037 theme 2 -- the base ``ValidationError``'s is
    ``VALIDATION_FAILED`` (conductor decision, fix round 1: the write
    pipeline's long-documented spelling, which REST, MCP and the CLI all
    already agreed on before this theme). ``exc.error_code`` is unconditional
    on every ``PyriteError`` subclass now, so there is no fallback case left
    to reach here: this function's own type hint (``exc: ValidationError``)
    guarantees a class code is always present. This is also the code

    A FastAPI dependency, because the pydantic request models drop every key
    they do not declare -- a `body_truncated` nested under any other key would
    never reach the service, while the body it marks would. This reads the raw
    JSON and applies the service's own check (``ensure_not_truncated``) at any
    depth, before the handler runs.

    A request whose payload is not JSON (a multipart upload, an empty body) is
    left alone: there is nothing to inspect, and `/entries/import` hands each
    parsed record to the pipeline, which checks it.

    **The JSON test mirrors FastAPI's own**, deliberately. FastAPI parses a
    body whenever the media type's maintype is `application` and its subtype
    is `json` or ends `+json`, lower-cased by `email.message` first
    (`fastapi/routing.py::get_request_handler`). A narrower test here does not
    make the guard conservative -- it makes it *bypassable*, because the

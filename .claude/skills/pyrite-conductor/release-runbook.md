# Release & Deploy Runbook

Procedural reference for the `dev → main` release path and the deploy script. SKILL.md keeps the daily-development rules (branches, committing); this file holds the runbook steps that only fire when shipping.

> **Maintainer-only.** Cutting releases and running the deploy script need push
> rights to `main` and the gitignored `pyrite_deployments/` directory, which
> holds the maintainer's site configs. Contributors never need this file: open a
> PR against `dev` (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releasing (dev → main)

Only release when the user explicitly asks to. The decision stays the
maintainer's; **executing it is one command**:

```bash
scripts/release.py X.Y.Z             # dry run (the DEFAULT): prints every step,
                                     # changes nothing
scripts/release.py X.Y.Z --execute   # cut it
```

**The rule the script enforces: the commit that gets tagged is a commit CI
already passed.** All release edits happen on `dev`; `main` only ever
fast-forwards. Never commit on `main` (a version bump there is an untested
commit, and it makes `main` diverge from `dev` so the next release needs a
real merge).

### Before you run it

Three things the script checks and cannot do for you. They belong on `dev`, in
one commit, pushed and green *before* you release:

- `pyproject.toml` `version` — the ONLY place it is written;
  `pyrite.__version__` reads it and `tests/test_version_consistency.py` checks
  it.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — open the section being released, `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
  (today). Its **entries do not go here**: they are the fragments under
  `changelog.d/`, which the script assembles into this section in step (e).
  Write only the lede if the release has one ("Operational — see
  `kb/roadmap.md`"). A section that is empty *and* has no fragments to fill it
  is refused; `[Unreleased]` must still be empty (it always is — see
  `changelog.d/README.md`).
- `SECURITY.md` supported-versions table, if the minor changed.

```bash
git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z" -- pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
git push -u origin release-prep && gh pr create --base dev --fill   # dev takes PRs only
```

Read the notes before you cut: step (a) prints the assembled section (the lede
plus every fragment, in Keep a Changelog order) — that is the whole point of a
dry run, and it is the last place the notes can be corrected cheaply.

One-time prerequisite: the `release-blocker` label must exist. The script
refuses to release while an open PR carries it — and refuses to release at all
while the label is *missing*, because it cannot ask the question. It never
creates labels; it fails with the command to run:

```bash
gh label create release-blocker --repo pyrite-wiki/pyrite \
  --description 'Must not ship in the next release' --color B60205
```

### What each step checks

| Step | Checks | Irreversible |
|------|--------|--------------|
| a. preconditions | clean checkout, on `dev`, HEAD exactly `origin/dev`; `origin` resolves to `pyrite-wiki/pyrite` (the repo the `gh` calls name); `vX.Y.Z` exists neither locally, on `origin`, nor as a GitHub release; `origin/main` is an ancestor of the SHA, so step d's push can only fast-forward; `pyproject.toml` version == X.Y.Z; CHANGELOG section dated today with content *or* fragments under `changelog.d/` to fill it, every fragment naming a known section, and no stranded `[Unreleased]`; the `release-blocker` label exists and no open PR carries it. **Prints the assembled release notes** | no |
| b. CI | the **required checks** for that exact SHA concluded success — `gate` by default, newest run per check name so a rerun to green counts. Never starts a run; `--wait-ci MINUTES` waits out a pending one (default 15) | no |
| c. release layer | what a *user* gets, **before the tag exists** (ADR-0032 §3a): install from the SHA into a throwaway `uv` venv, `pyrite --version` equals X.Y.Z, `scripts/run_tutorial.sh` (the Quick Start) run against that install, `docker build` when docker is present — a loud note when it is not | no |
| d. publish | fast-forward `main` to the SHA (`git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/main`; the ruleset allows only a fast-forward), tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the tag, `gh release create` with the CHANGELOG section, the assembled fragments, and the contributors line | **yes** |
| e. post-release | **consume the fragments** — write the assembled sections into `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [X.Y.Z]` and delete the files from `changelog.d/` — and reopen `## [Unreleased]`, in one commit on a fresh `release/reopen-unreleased-X.Y.Z` branch cut from the release commit (local `dev` is never committed on); print the `git push -u origin …` / `gh pr create --base dev --fill` lines. A no-op only when there are no fragments *and* `[Unreleased]` is already there | **yes** |
| f. handoff | prints what the release does *not* do and cannot: **pyrite.wiki** (below), the deploys the tag does not trigger, the `[Unreleased]` PR, the announcement. Changes nothing | no |

**pyrite.wiki is not automated and cannot be.** The marketing site lives
outside this repo, and it carries version-specific claims — the version it
names, install commands pinned to a tag, and the counts it quotes (MCP tools,
tests, ADRs) — that go stale silently the moment a release lands. The top
GitHub referrer for the repo is chatgpt.com, so those numbers are what gets
quoted to prospective users; `docs-counts-generated-or-asserted-from-code`
tracks fixing the drift at the source. Until then, step f reminds you and you
update the site by hand.

If step **a** says `origin/main` is not an ancestor of the SHA, `main` has
commits `dev` lacks: stop and find out why (a hotfix that was never merged
back?) before going further. It is checked there, not discovered in step d,
because step d moves `main` before it tags — a failure halfway through is the
one thing the ordering exists to prevent.

If something does fail after step d has started, the run says which commands
already ran and that their effects stand, instead of "nothing further was
attempted".

**Required checks, and why not "all green".** `gate` is the required check on
`dev` and `main`; it needs the jobs that must pass, so requiring it requires
them. Checks *not* named are advisory and reported but never blocking — `e2e`
runs on pushes to `main` and is deliberately outside `gate`'s needs (ADR-0032
§3a keeps breadth out of the merge gate), so a red or merely slow `e2e` must
not hold a tag. `--require-check NAME` (repeatable) changes the set.

### Safety

`--dry-run` is the default; `--execute` is the only way anything is written.
Every irreversible command is printed verbatim first, and printed *instead of*
running without `--execute`. The script never passes `--no-verify`, never
force-pushes, never deletes a ref, and refuses a dirty checkout or a HEAD that
is not exactly `origin/dev`. `gh` reads answer the checks; `gh` writes are
printed.

Step c is minutes of real network, so a dry run prints it rather than running
it. `--install-check` performs it for real *without* `--execute` — that is how
to rehearse the release layer before release day. `--skip-install-check` drops
it, and then the clean-venv check is yours by hand:

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/relcheck && /tmp/relcheck/bin/pip install -q \
  "pyrite[all] @ git+https://github.com/pyrite-wiki/pyrite@vX.Y.Z"
/tmp/relcheck/bin/python -c "import pyrite; print(pyrite.__version__)"   # X.Y.Z
```

Contributors are credited automatically: every outside author of a PR merged
since the previous tag becomes `Thanks to @a, @b for their contributions.` at
the end of the notes. Contributors are why the project is not a solo project;
the notes say so.

Version numbers follow the roadmap, not the calendar: a minor (0.25) names a
milestone with a definition of done. Do not tag it until that is met; ship
fixes as patch releases of the current minor meanwhile.

**PyPI**: not reachable. The `pyrite` name is held by a locked pre-2FA account (ADR-0025, amended 2026-09-17), so `publish.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only and a GitHub release publishes nothing. Install path is `pip install git+https://github.com/pyrite-wiki/pyrite@<tag>`.

## Deploying

Use the deployment script at `pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh` (gitignored, local only):

```bash
# Check all sites
./pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh status

# Deploy latest dev to demo.pyrite.wiki
./pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh demo

# Deploy cascade (code only — fast, no re-index)
./pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh cascade

# Deploy cascade with full re-seed (re-copy KB data, rebuild index, re-export, re-render)
./pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh cascade --reseed

# Deploy specific tag to pyrite.ink
./pyrite_deployments/deploy.sh ink v0.21.0
```

**When to use `--reseed`:** when KB content changed (new events, fixed bodies), or when the export/render code changed (new fields in site cache, new source data in timeline.json).

## Hotfixes

For urgent fixes to a release:

Prefer a normal patch release (above): if `dev` is releasable, fast-forward it.
Only when `dev` carries work that must not ship yet:

1. Branch `hotfix/vX.Y.Z` from the release tag, cherry-pick the fix from `dev`,
   bump the patch version there and open the CHANGELOG section (the fix's own
   fragment comes across with the cherry-pick), push, and wait for CI.
2. Fast-forward `main` to the hotfix branch, tag, release, deploy.
3. Merge `main` back into `dev` immediately, so `main` is an ancestor of `dev`
   again and the next release can fast-forward.

## Site mapping (which branch lands where)

| Site | Source | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
| `demo.pyrite.wiki` | `dev` HEAD | Auto on CI pass |
| `capturecascade.org` | `main` tag | Manual via `deploy.sh cascade` |
| `pyrite.ink` | `main` tag | Manual via `deploy.sh ink <tag>` |
| PyPI | — | Unreachable (locked account); `publish.yml` is manual-only |

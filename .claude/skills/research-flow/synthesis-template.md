# Synthesis Entry Template

Use this structure when creating the final synthesis entry for a research flow. Copy and adapt — not every section applies to every topic.

# Research: <Topic>

**Research question:** <Single sentence stating what was investigated>

**Date:** <When this research was conducted>
**KBs searched:** <List of KBs consulted>
**Search coverage:** keyword, semantic, hybrid (note which modes used)

## Key Findings

1. **<Finding>** (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)
   - Evidence: [[source-entry-1]], [[source-entry-2]]
   - <Brief explanation of what the evidence shows>

2. **<Finding>** (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)
   - Evidence: [[source-entry-3]]
   - <Brief explanation>

3. **<Finding>** (Confidence: Low/Speculative)
   - Evidence: [[source-entry-4]]
   - <Brief explanation, note limitations>

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | <What happened> | [[entry-id]] |
| YYYY-MM-DD | <What happened> | [[entry-id]] |

## Key Entities

| Entity | Role | Entries |
|--------|------|---------|
| <Person/Org> | <Their role in this topic> | [[entry-id]], [[entry-id]] |
| <Person/Org> | <Their role> | [[entry-id]] |

## Contradictions and Open Questions

- <Source A says X, but Source B says Y> — [[source-a]] vs [[source-b]]
- <Unexplained gap: why did X happen after Y?>
- <Alternative interpretation: could also mean...>

## Gaps in Coverage

- <What the KB doesn't have that would strengthen findings>
- <Missing source types, missing time periods, missing perspectives>
- <Entities mentioned but without their own entries>

## Recommendations

- <Specific follow-up research to fill gaps>
- <Entries that should be created or updated>
- <Connections to investigate further>
```

## Guidelines

- **Keep findings concise.** Each finding is 1-3 sentences. Link to full entries for detail.
- **Confidence is mandatory.** Every finding must have a confidence level. See SKILL.md for definitions.
- **Wikilinks are mandatory.** Every claim must link to its source entry. If there's no entry, create one first.
- **Gaps are valuable.** An honest "we don't know X" is more useful than a padded synthesis.
- **Recommendations are actionable.** "Investigate further" is vague. "Create a person entry for X and search for their connections to Y" is actionable.
